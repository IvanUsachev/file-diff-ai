#Document Comparison and Semantic Analysis Tool

A modular console-based application for automated comparison and semantic analysis of textual and Word documents. The system applies a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to detect additions, deletions, and modifications while preserving structural context such as headings, numbering, and article hierarchy. Differences are visualized in an interactive side-by-side HTML report with color-coded highlights for added, removed, and changed content.

The application also integrates the OpenAI ChatGPT API to generate natural-language summaries of detected revisions, providing clear insights into document changes. Supporting .doc, .docx, .pdf, and .txt formats, it combines deterministic diff computation with AI-driven interpretation for precise and intelligible document comparison.
